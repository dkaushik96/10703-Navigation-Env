    locally (local mode), (2) create a new simulator server in the current
    process (server mode), or (3) connect to a remote simulator server (client
    mode). This constructor may also be used to load a simulator from a file,
    and run it in either local mode or server mode.

    To construct a new simulator in local mode, a configuration must be
    specified with `sim_config`, `is_server` must be `False`, `server_address`
    must be unspecified, and `load_filepath` must be unspecified (the latter
    three arguments are default).

    To construct a new simulator in server mode, `sim_config` must be
    specified, `is_server` must be `True`, `server_address` must be
    unspecified, and `load_filepath` must be unspecified (the latter two
    arguments are default). The arguments `port`, `conn_queue_capacity`, and
    `num_workers` may be used to change aspects of the server.

    To connect to an existing simulator server (i.e. construct the simulator in
    client mode), `sim_config` must be unspecified, but `server_address` must
    be specified. If provided, `on_lost_connection_callback` is called if the
    client loses its connection to the server.

    To load a simulator from a file, `sim_config` must be unspecified,
    `load_filepath` is set to the name of file to load **excluding** the
    simulation time. The simulation time to load must be specified with
    `load_time`. In client mode, the agents are loaded from the given filepath.

    Arguments:
      on_step_callback    (all modes) The callback invoked when the simulator
                          completes a step.
      sim_config          (local and server modes) Configuration for the new
                          simulator.
      is_server           Indicates whether this simulation is to be run as a
                          server.
      server_address      (client mode) The address of the simulator server to
                          connect to.
      port                (server mode) The port of the simulator server.
      conn_queue_capacity (server mode) The maximum number of simultaneous
                          connection attempts that the server will attempt to
                          process.
      num_workers         (server mode) The number of worker threads that will
                          be used to process incoming client messages.
      on_lost_connection_callback (client mode) The function that is called
                          when the client loses its connection with the server.
      save_frequency      (local and server modes) Indicates how often the
                          simulator and the agents should be saved to
                          `save_filepath`. Note that if `save_filepath` is
                          unspecified, this parameter has no effect.
      save_filepath       (all modes) The path where the simulator and agents
                          are saved (in client mode, only agents are saved).
                          The directory containing this path is created if it
                          doesn't already exist.
      load_filepath       (all modes) The path from which the simulator and
                          agents are loaded (in client mode, only agents are
                          loaded). This **should not** contain the simulation
                          time. Instead, the time should be specified via
                          `load_time`.
      load_time           (all modes) The simulation time to load. This is used
                          in conjunction with `load_filepath` to determine the
                          precise filenames to load.
